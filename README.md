# BigDataFinalProject
Jupyter notebook used to analyze a large (>300 MB) dataset to extract features using big data techniques as well as make predictions.
Used techniques learned from Big Data Systems and Application Development course in order to simply and swiftly extract and observe data.
PySpark was used in this project which is a Python implementation of Apache Spark, the Big Data framework.

Kaggle dataset used to pull data from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hugomathien/soccer

As this was written for a graduate course project, I have added no license as this code should not be used by others.
